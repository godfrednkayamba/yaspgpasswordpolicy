### [Description](#description)

The `yaspgpasswordpolicy` PostgreSQL extension provides few general credential checks, which will be evaluated during the user creation, during the password change and user renaming. By using this extension, we can define a set of rules:

- allow a specific set of credentials
- reject a certain type of credentials
- deny password that can be easily cracked
- enforce use of an expiration date with a minimum of day for a password
- define a password reuse policy
- define the number of authentication failure allowed before a user is banned

This extension provides all the checks as configurable parameters. The default configuration settings, will not enforce any complex checks and will try to allow most of the credentials. By using `SET yaspgpasswordpolicy.<check-name> TO <some value>;` command, enforce new settings for the credential checks. The settings can only be changed by a superuser.

### [Installation](#installation)

To install the yaspgpasswordpolicy extension you need a PostgreSQL version upper than 10
but if you want to use the Password Reuse Policy feature the minimum version
required is 12.

This extension must be compiled with pgxs, so the `pg_config` tool must be
available from your PATH environment variable.

If you want to use the "deny password that can be easily cracked" feature you
need to edit the `Makefile` to enable the following lines:

	#PG_CPPFLAGS = -DUSE_CRACKLIB '-DCRACKLIB_DICTPATH="/usr/lib/cracklib_dict"'
	#SHLIB_LINK = -lcrack

Depending on your installation, you may need to install some devel packages.

	sudo yum -y install cracklib cracklib-devel cracklib-dicts words
or
	sudo apt install libpam-cracklib libcrack2-dev

You will also have to build the dictionary to be used, following your distribution:

	mkdict /usr/share/dict/* | sudo packer /usr/lib/cracklib_dict
or
	cracklib-format /usr/share/dict/* | sudo cracklib-packer /usr/lib/cracklib_dic

Once it is done, do "make", and then "sudo make install".

Append `yaspgpasswordpolicy` to `shared_preload_libraries` configuration parameter in your
`postgresql.conf` file then restart the PostgreSQL database to apply the changes.

The regression tests can be run by using the `make installcheck` command.

### [Checks](#checks)

Please find the below list of general checks, which we can enforce on credentials.

| password_valid_max        | password | force use of VALID UNTIL clause in CREATE ROLE statement with a maximum number of days   | 365             | &check; CREATE ROLE abcd VALID UNTIL (now()+'6 months'::interval)::date | &#10008;  CREATE ROLE abcd VALID UNTIL (now()+'2 years'::interval)::date; |

There is also the `yaspgpasswordpolicy.whitelist` GUC that can be used to set a comma separated list of username to exclude from the password policy check. For example:
```
yaspgpasswordpolicy.whitelist = 'admin,supuser'
```
will disable any yaspgpasswordpolicy policy for the user named `admin` and  `supuser`.

### [Examples](#examples)

Let us start with a simple check as every username should be of length minimum 4 characters.

```
postgres=# SHOW yaspgpasswordpolicy.username_min_length;
 yaspgpasswordpolicy.username_min_length 
-------------------------------
 4
(1 row)

postgres=# CREATE USER abc WITH PASSWORD 'pass';
ERROR:  username length should match the configured yaspgpasswordpolicy.username_min_length

postgres=# CREATE USER abcd WITH PASSWORD 'pass';
CREATE ROLE
```

Let us enforce an another check as every username should contain a special character in it.

```
postgres=# SHOW yaspgpasswordpolicy.username_min_special;
 yaspgpasswordpolicy.username_min_special 
--------------------------------
 1
(1 row)

postgres=# CREATE USER abcd WITH PASSWORD 'pass';
ERROR:  username does not contain the configured yaspgpasswordpolicy.username_min_special characters

postgres=# CREATE USER abcd$ WITH PASSWORD 'pass';
CREATE ROLE
```

Let us add one more check to the username, where username should not contain more than 1 adjacent repeat character.


```
postgres=# show yaspgpasswordpolicy.username_min_repeat ;
 yaspgpasswordpolicy.username_min_repeat 
-------------------------------
 1
(1 row)

postgres=# CREATE USER week$ WITH PASSWORD 'pass';
ERROR:  username characters are repeated more than the configured yaspgpasswordpolicy.username_min_repeat times

postgres=# CREATE USER weak$ WITH PASSWORD 'pass';
CREATE ROLE

postgres=# SHOW yaspgpasswordpolicy.username_min_repeat ;
 yaspgpasswordpolicy.username_min_repeat 
-------------------------------
 2
(1 row)

postgres=# CREATE USER week$ WITH PASSWORD 'pass';
CREATE ROLE
```

Now, let us add some checks for the password.
Let us start with a check as a password should not contain these characters (!@=$#).

```
postgres=# SHOW yaspgpasswordpolicy.password_not_contain ;
 yaspgpasswordpolicy.password_not_contain 
--------------------------------
 !@=$#
(1 row)

postgres=# CREATE USER abcd$ WITH PASSWORD 'p@ss';
ERROR:  password does contain the configured yaspgpasswordpolicy.password_not_contain characters

postgres=# CREATE USER abcd$ WITH PASSWORD 'pass';
CREATE ROLE
```

Let us add another check for the password as, the password should not contain username.

```
postgres=# SHOW yaspgpasswordpolicy.password_contain_username ;
 yaspgpasswordpolicy.password_contain_username 
-------------------------------------
 on
(1 row)

postgres=# CREATE USER abcd$ WITH PASSWORD 'abcd$xyz';
ERROR:  password should not contain username

-- OK, ignore case is disabled
postgres=# CREATE USER abcd$ WITH PASSWORD 'ABCD$xyz';
CREATE ROLE

postgres=# CREATE USER abcd$ WITH PASSWORD 'axyz';
CREATE ROLE
```

Let us make checks as to ignore the case.

```
postgres=# SHOW yaspgpasswordpolicy.password_ignore_case;
 yaspgpasswordpolicy.password_ignore_case 
--------------------------------
 on
(1 row)

postgres=# CREATE USER abcd$ WITH PASSWORD 'ABCD$xyz';
ERROR:  password should not contain username

postgres=# CREATE USER abcd$ WITH PASSWORD 'A$xyz';
CREATE ROLE
```

Let us add one final check to the password as the password should not contain any adjacent repeated characters.

```
postgres=# SHOW yaspgpasswordpolicy.password_min_repeat ;
 yaspgpasswordpolicy.password_min_repeat 
-------------------------------
 3
(1 row)

postgres=# CREATE USER abcd$ WITH PASSWORD 'straaaangepaasssword';
ERROR:  password characters are repeated more than the configured yaspgpasswordpolicy.password_min_repeat times

postgres=# CREATE USER abcd$ WITH PASSWORD 'straaangepaasssword';
CREATE ROLE
```

yaspgpasswordpolicy can also enforce the use of an expiration date for the password by checking option VALID UNTIL used in CREATE or ALTER ROLE.
```
postgres=# SET yaspgpasswordpolicy.password_valid_until = 30;
SET

postgres=# SET yaspgpasswordpolicy.password_valid_max = 180;
SET

postgres=# CREATE USER abcd$;
ERROR:  require a VALID UNTIL option with a date older than 30 days

postgres=# CREATE USER abcd$ VALID UNTIL '2022-12-21';
ERROR:  require a VALID UNTIL option with a date older than 30 days

postgres=# ALTER USER abcd$ VALID UNTIL '2022-12-21';
ERROR:  require a VALID UNTIL option with a date older than 30 days

postgres=# ALTER USER abcd$ VALID UNTIL '2025-12-21';
ERROR:  require a VALID UNTIL option with a date not beyond 180 days
```

If you have enabled the use of cracklib to check the easiness of a password
you could have this kind of messages:
```
postgres=# CREATE USER my_easy_password with password 'pass123';
ERROR:  password is easily cracked
```

### [Password reuse policy](#password-reuse-policy)

PostgreSQL supports natively password expiration, all other kinds of password policy enforcement comes with extensions.
With the yaspgpasswordpolicy extension, password can be forced to be of a certain length, contain amounts of various types of characters and be checked against the user account name itself.

But one thing was missing, there was no password reuse policy enforcement. That mean that when user were required to change their password, they could just reuse their current password!

The yaspgpasswordpolicy extension adds the "Password Reuse Policy" in release 1.0. To used this feature, the yaspgpasswordpolicy extension MUST be added to `shared_preload_libraries` configuration option.

All users passwords are historicized in shared memory together with the timestamps of when these passwords were set. The passwords history is saved into a file named `$PGDATA/pg_password_history` to be reloaded in shared memory at startup. This file must be part of your backups if you don't want to loose the password history, hopefully pg_basebackup will take care of it. Passwords are stored and compared as sha256 hashes, never in plain text.

The password history size is set to 65535 records by default and can be adjusted using the `yaspgpasswordpolicy.history_max_size` configuration directive. Change of this GUC require a PostgreSQL restart. One record in the history takes 144 bytes, so the default is to allocate around 10 MB of additional shared memory for the password history.

Two settings allow to control the behavior of this feature:

* `yaspgpasswordpolicy.password_reuse_history`: number of distinct passwords set before a password can be reused.
* `yaspgpasswordpolicy.password_reuse_interval`: amount of time it takes before a password can be reused again.

The default value for these settings are 0 which means that all password reuse policies are disabled.

The password history consists of passwords a user has been assigned in the past. yaspgpasswordpolicy can
restrict new passwords from being chosen from this history:

* If an account is restricted on the basis of number of password changes, a new password cannot be chosen from the `password_reuse_history` most recent passwords. For example, minimum number of password changes is set to 3, a new password cannot be the same as any of the most recent 3 passwords.

* If an account is restricted based on time elapsed, a new password cannot be chosen from passwords in the history that are newer than `password_reuse_interval` days. For example, if the password reuse interval is set to 365, a new password must not be among those previously chosen within the last year. 

To be able to list the content of the history a view is provided in the database you have created
the yaspgpasswordpolicy extension. The view is named `public.pg_password_history`. This view is visible by everyone.

A superuser can also reset the content of the password history by calling a function named `public.pg_password_history_reset()`. If it is called without an argument, all the passwords history will be cleared. To only remove the records registered for a single user, just pass his name as parameter. This function returns the number of records removed from the history.

Example:
```
SET yaspgpasswordpolicy.password_reuse_history = 2;
CREATE USER credtest WITH PASSWORD 'H8Hdre=S2';
ALTER USER credtest PASSWORD 'J8YuRe=6O';
SELECT rolename, password_hash FROM pg_password_history WHERE rolename = 'credtest' ORDER BY password_date;
 rolename |                          password_hash
----------+------------------------------------------------------------------
 credtest | 7488570b80076cf9da26644d5eeb316c4768ff5bee7bf319344e7bb328032098
 credtest | e61e58c22aa6bf31a92b385932f7d0e4dbaba24fa3fdb2982510d6c72a961335
(2 rows)

-- fail, the credential is still in the history
ALTER USER credtest PASSWORD 'J8YuRe=6O';
ERROR:  Cannot use this credential following the password reuse policy

-- Reset the password history
SELECT pg_password_history_reset();
 pg_password_history_reset
---------------------------
                         2
(1 row)
```

Example for password reuse interval:
```
SET yaspgpasswordpolicy.password_reuse_history = 1;
SET yaspgpasswordpolicy.password_reuse_interval = 365;
-- Add a new password in the history and set its age to 100 days
ALTER USER credtest PASSWORD 'J8YuRe=6O';
SELECT pg_password_history_timestamp('credtest', now()::timestamp - '100 days'::interval);
 pg_password_history_timestamp
-------------------------------
                             1
(1 row)

SELECT * FROM pg_password_history WHERE rolename = 'credtest';
 rolename |         password_date         |                          password_hash                           
----------+-------------------------------+------------------------------------------------------------------
 credtest | 2022-12-15 13:41:06.736775+03 | c38cf85ca6c3e5ee72c09cf0bfb42fb29b0f0a3e8ba335637941d60f86512508
(1 row)

-- fail, the password is in the history for less than 1 year
ALTER USER credtest PASSWORD 'J8YuRe=6O';
ERROR:  Cannot use this credential following the password reuse policy
-- Change the age of the password to exceed the 1 year interval
SELECT pg_password_history_timestamp('credtest', now()::timestamp - '380 days'::interval);
 pg_password_history_timestamp
-------------------------------
                             2
(1 row)

-- success, the old password present in the history has expired and will be removed
ALTER USER credtest PASSWORD 'J8YuRe=6O';
SELECT rolename, password_hash FROM pg_password_history WHERE rolename = 'credtest';
 rolename |         password_date         |                          password_hash                           
----------+-------------------------------+------------------------------------------------------------------
 credtest | 2023-03-25 13:42:37.387629+03 | c38cf85ca6c3e5ee72c09cf0bfb42fb29b0f0a3e8ba335637941d60f86512508
(1 row)
```

Function `pg_password_history_timestamp()` is provided for testing purpose only and allow a superuer
to change the timestamp of all registered passwords in the history.

### [Authentication failure ban](#authentication-failure-ban)

PostgreSQL doesn't have any mechanism to limit the number of authentication failure attempt before the user being banned.  With the yaspgpasswordpolicy extension, after an amount of authentication failure defined by configuration directive `yaspgpasswordpolicy.max_auth_failure` the user can be banned and never connect anymore even if it gives the right password later.

The yaspgpasswordpolicy extension adds the "Authentication failure ban" feature in release 2.0. To used this feature, the yaspgpasswordpolicy extension MUST be added to `shared_preload_libraries` configuration option.

All users authentication failures are registered in shared memory with the timestamps of when the user have been banned. The authentication failures history is saved into memory only, that mean that the history is lost at PostgreSQL restart. I have not seen the interest to restore the cache at startup

The authentication failure cache size is set to 1024 records by default and can be adjusted using the `yaspgpasswordpolicy.auth_failure_cache_size` configuration directive. Change of this GUC require a PostgreSQL restart.

Two settings allow to control the behavior of this feature:

* `yaspgpasswordpolicy.max_auth_failure`: number of authentication failure allowed for a user before being banned.
* `yaspgpasswordpolicy.reset_superuser` : force superuser to not be banned or reset a banned superuser when set to true.

The default value for the first setting is `0` which means that the authentication failure ban feature is disabled.
The default value for the second setting is `false` which means that `postgres` superuser can be banned.

In case the `postgres` superuser was banned, he can not logged anymore. If there is no other superuser account that can be used to reset the record of the banned superuser, set the `yaspgpasswordpolicy.reset_superuser`configuration directive to `true` into postgresql.conf file and send the SIGHUP signal to the PostgreSQL process pid so that it will reread the configuration. Next time the superuser will try to connect, its authentication failure cache entry will be removed.

Example: `kill -1 1234`

A superuser can also reset the content of the banned user cache by calling a function named `public.pg_banned_role_reset()`. If it is called without an argument, all the banned cache will be cleared. To only remove the record registered for a single user, just pass his name as parameter. This function returns the number of records removed from the cache. A restart of PostgreSQL also clear the cache.

Example:
```
$ psql -h localhost -U toban_user -d gilles
Password for user toban_user: 
psql: error: connection to server at "localhost" (127.0.0.1), port 5432 failed: FATAL:  password authentication failed for user "toban_user"
connection to server at "localhost" (127.0.0.1), port 5432 failed: FATAL:  password authentication failed for user "toban_user"

$ psql -h localhost -U toban_user -d gilles
Password for user toban_user: 
psql: error: connection to server at "localhost" (127.0.0.1), port 5432 failed: FATAL:  password authentication failed for user "toban_user"
connection to server at "localhost" (127.0.0.1), port 5432 failed: FATAL:  password authentication failed for user "toban_user"

$ psql -h localhost -U toban_user -d gilles
Password for user toban_user: 
psql: error: connection to server at "localhost" (127.0.0.1), port 5432 failed: FATAL:  rejecting connection, user 'toban_user' has been banned
connection to server at "localhost" (127.0.0.1), port 5432 failed: FATAL:  rejecting connection, user 'toban_user' has been banned
```
```
test=# SELECT * FROM pg_banned_role;
 roleid | failure_count |        banned_date         
--------+---------------+----------------------------
 250362 |             2 | 2023-06-09 20:33:58.490273
(1 row)

test=# SELECT pg_banned_role_reset();
 pg_banned_role_reset 
----------------------
                    1
(1 row)

test=# SELECT * FROM pg_banned_role;
 roleid | failure_count | banned_date 
--------+---------------+-------------
(0 rows)
```

and then another login attempt is allowed:
```
$ psql -h localhost -U toban_user -d gilles
Password for user toban_user: 
psql: error: connection to server at "localhost" (127.0.0.1), port 5432 failed: FATAL:  password authentication failed for user "toban_user"
connection to server at "localhost" (127.0.0.1), port 5432 failed: FATAL:  password authentication failed for user "toban_user"
```

If you want to exclude some users from being banned, like application users for example, you can set a whitelist of username that must be excluded from this behavior.
```
	yaspgpasswordpolicy.whitelist_auth_failure = 'appuser1,appuser2'
```

### [Authentication delay](#authentication-delay)

This feature allow a pause on authentication failure. Setting `yaspgpasswordpolicy.auth_delay_ms` causes the server to pause for a given number of milliseconds before reporting authentication failure. This makes brute-force attacks on database passwords more difficult. 

### [Limitations](#limitations)

This extension only works for the plain text passwords.

Example
```
postgres=# CREATE USER user1 PASSWORD 'this is some plain text';
CREATE ROLE
```
An error will report, if any user trying to create user with an ENCRYPTED password.

Example
```   
postgres=# CREATE USER user1 PASSWORD 'md55e4cc86d2d6a8b73bbefc4d5b91baa45';
ERROR:  password type is not a plain text
```

To allow the use of encrypted password in CREATE or ALTER ROLE, enable configuration custom
variable `yaspgpasswordpolicy.encrypted_password_allowed`.

This also affect the `\password` psql command as it sends encrypted passord to the backend.
 
Username checks will not get enforced while create an user without password, and while renaming the user if the user doesn't have a password defined.

Example (username checks won't invoke here)
```
postgres=# CREATE USER user1;
```

Example (username checks won't invoke here)
```
postgres=# ALTER USER user1 RENAME to test_user;
```

Example (username checks will invoke here and on the rename statement too)
```
postgres=# CREATE USER user1 PASSWORD 'this is some plain text';
CREATE ROLE
postgres=# ALTER USER user1 RENAME to test_user;
```
